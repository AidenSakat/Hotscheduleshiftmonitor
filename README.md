# Hotscheduleshiftmonitor
This project is a web automation script built with Python, leveraging the Selenium WebDriver for interacting with a scheduling website. The script automates the process of checking for available shifts and picking them up based on specific criteria. It logs into the website using user credentials, and continuously monitors shifts for days.
